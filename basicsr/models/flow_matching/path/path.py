class ProbPath(ABC):
    r"""Abstract class, representing a probability path.

    A probability path transforms the distribution :math:`p(X_0)` into :math:`p(X_1)` over :math:`t=0\rightarrow 1`.

    The ``ProbPath`` class is designed to support model training in the flow matching framework. It supports two key functionalities: (1) sampling the conditional probability path and (2) conversion between various training objectives.
    Here is a high-level example

    .. code-block:: python

        # Instantiate a probability path
        my_path = ProbPath(...)

        for x_0, x_1 in dataset:
            # Sets t to a random value in [0,1]
            t = torch.rand()

            # Samples the conditional path X_t ~ p_t(X_t|X_0,X_1)
            path_sample = my_path.sample(x_0=x_0, x_1=x_1, t=t)

            # Optimizes the model. The loss function varies, depending on model and path.
            loss(path_sample, my_model(x_t, t)).backward()
