# SplitMeanFlow - Unofficial Implementation


This is an **unofficial implementation** of SplitMeanFlow from the paper **"SplitMeanFlow: Interval Splitting Consistency in Few-Step Generative Modeling"** by ByteDance. [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16884)]. This implementation is based on my understanding of the paper and uses the DiT architecture as the backbone.

**Note: This is not the official implementation. For the official code, please refer to the authors' repository when it becomes available.**

## Overview

SplitMeanFlow introduces a novel approach for few-step generation by learning average velocity fields through an algebraic consistency principle. The key innovation is avoiding expensive Jacobian-Vector Product (JVP) computations while achieving one-step generation quality comparable to traditional multi-step methods.

## Setup

Create the conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate splitmeanflow
```


## Training

### Stage 1: Teacher Model
First, train a standard flow matching teacher:
```bash
python train_teacher_mnist.py
```

Samples in training:

The training log here: ![training log comet](assets/mnist_log.png)

You can download the teacher model at [model](https://github.com/primepake/splitmeanflow/releases/tag/mnist)
### Stage 2: Student Model  
Then train the SplitMeanFlow student:
```bash
python train_student.py
```

Samples in training:

### 1st Step <br/>

### 2st Step <br/>

### 4st Step <br/>
![Samples](assets/4step.jpg)

The training log here: ![training log comet](assets/student_mnist_log.png)

The training follows Algorithm 1 from the paper with some modifications based on my interpretation.

## Experimental Results
- [x] Trained MNIST dataset 
- [ ] Trained CIFAR10 dataset


**Disclaimer: These are preliminary results from my implementation and may not match the paper's performance.**


## Known Issues & Differences from Paper

1. **Performance Gap**: My implementation doesn't quite reach the paper's reported metrics
2. **Training Stability**: Occasionally encounter NaN losses - added gradient clipping as workaround
3. **CFG Handling**: My interpretation of CFG-free training might differ from the official approach
4. **Time Sampling**: Using uniform sampling instead of log-normal as mentioned in paper
